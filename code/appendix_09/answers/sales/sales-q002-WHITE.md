# sales-q002 — White

> Metadata
> - **Model:** gemma3:1b
> - **Prompt:** `prompts/sales/sales-q002-White.prompt.txt`

**Overall Score:** 4.75

## Summary
Analysis of customer segment data reveals a strong correlation between customer lifetime value and the most profitable segments. While data is present, further quantification of these relationships would strengthen the assessment. The model utilizes a combination of historical data analysis and predictive modeling, demonstrating a robust approach to identifying high-value customer segments.
