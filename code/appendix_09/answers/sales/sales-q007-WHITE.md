> Metadata
> - **Model:** gemma3:1b
> - **Prompt:** `prompts/sales/sales-q007-White.prompt.txt`

**Overall Score:** 4.2

## Summary
The optimal strategy leverages a weighted approach combining conservative margin protection with strategic discounting to maximize return while minimizing risk to win rates. A robust model considers both financial and operational variables, requiring quantifiable thresholds for margins and discounting rates.

## Criteria Scores
| Criteria | Score |
|---|---|
| Problem Framing | 5 |
| Coverage | 5 |
| Specificity | 4 |
| Actionability | 4 |
| Distinctiveness | 4 |
| Clarity | 4 |

## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Prioritization of conservative margin targets.
- Integration of risk assessment through discounting rates.
- Focus on maximizing overall profitability
- A balanced approach between maximizing profit and minimizing potential losses
- Incorporating historical data trends to inform strategic decisions

**Weaknesses:**
- Lack of specific discount rates, requiring further clarification
- Limited consideration of long-term profitability impacts.
- Insufficient quantification of risk reduction potential.
- No explicit consideration for customer segmentation
