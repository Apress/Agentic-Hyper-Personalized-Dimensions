## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Recognizes the importance of sustainability – a crucial element absent from purely volume-driven approaches.
- Points to the potential for misalignment – current models could unintentionally stifle growth.
- Acknowledges a potential risk of short-term gains at the expense of future profitability.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lacks specific examples of how alignment *specifically* translates into profit – requires elaboration.
- Doesn't address the underlying motivation for volume-driven strategies – exploring this is vital for mitigation.
- Limited discussion of potential resistance to change – needs a consideration of this.
