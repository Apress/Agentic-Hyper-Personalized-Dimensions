## Summary
The current channel landscape reveals a compelling combination of existing partnerships and untapped potential. While established partnerships provide a stable revenue base, diversification offers significant growth opportunities. Our analysis indicates that strategic expansion, particularly focusing on value-added services and niche markets, will be pivotal for maximizing profitability. Existing channels are well-established, but offer limited avenues for innovation – we need to extrapolate and create new revenue streams.
