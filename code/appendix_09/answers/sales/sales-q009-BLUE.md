**Overall Score:** 4.8

## Summary
The current sales forecasting accuracy, while adequate, presents opportunities for significant improvement. A thorough analysis reveals a need for more granular data and proactive adjustments to mitigate potential forecasting errors. We must prioritize a structured approach to optimize forecasting models and enhance data integration across departments.

## Criteria Scores
| Criteria | Score |
|---|---|
| Problem Framing | 4 |
| Coverage | 5 |
| Specificity | 4 |
| Actionability | 4 |
| Distinctiveness | 5 |
| Clarity | 5 |

## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Clearly identifies the need for improved accuracy.
- Highlights the complexity of the current forecasting process.
- Emphasizes the potential for increased revenue through better forecasting.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lacks specific metrics to quantify the current accuracy level (e.g., MAPE, RMSE).
- Doesn't address potential root causes of inaccurate forecasting (e.g., seasonality, market trends).
- Doesn't suggest specific improvement strategies beyond a general overview.
