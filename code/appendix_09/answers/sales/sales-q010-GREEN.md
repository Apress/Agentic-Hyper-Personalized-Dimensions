> Metadata
> - **Model:** gemma3:1b
> - **Prompt:** `prompts/sales/sales-q010-Green.prompt.txt`

**Overall Score:** 4.7

## Summary
A comprehensive analysis reveals a solid foundation for incentivizing profit, requiring focused refinement of current approaches. Initial assessment indicates a strong understanding of the core challenge, but warrants deeper exploration of the underlying mechanisms driving current performance metrics.

## Criteria Scores
| Criteria | Score |
|---|---|
| Problem Framing | 4 |
| Coverage | 5 |
| Specificity | 4 |
| Actionability | 4 |
| Distinctiveness | 5 |
| Clarity | 5 |

## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Identifies the critical need for a shift from volume-based incentives to value-driven goals.
- Recognizes the potential for misinterpretation of current reward structures, suggesting a need for pilot testing of novel metrics.
- Considers the psychological impact of increased focus on profit, suggesting the need for greater transparency and accountability.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lacks specific examples of alternative incentive models currently in use – requires analysis of existing practices to inform recommendations.
- Doesn't delve into potential obstacles to implementation – an exploration of resistance to change is needed.
- Doesn't explicitly consider long-term strategic alignment – emphasizing immediate profit goals at the expense of sustainable growth is a risk.
