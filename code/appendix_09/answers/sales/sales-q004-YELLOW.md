**Strengths:**

- Emphasizes identifying unmet needs through a data-driven approach, suggesting targeted offerings.

- Considers customer lifetime value (CLTV) – aiming to increase overall spending.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lacks granular data on current customer engagement and usage patterns to definitively determine optimal cross-sell strategies. Requires more precise customer segmentation data for effective targeting.
