# sales-q006 — Yellow

> Metadata
> - **Model:** gemma3:1b
> - **Prompt:** `prompts/sales/sales-q006-Yellow.prompt.txt`

**Overall Score:** 4.6

## Summary
Pipeline velocity bottlenecks are a critical area for optimization, and identifying them requires a rigorous analysis of current throughput. The assessment highlights significant potential for improvement through targeted interventions. While the data quality currently leans towards a 'good' level of detail, a deeper investigation into the specific bottlenecks will yield more substantial value. The current assessment demonstrates a reasonable balance between identifying potential issues and outlining actionable pathways.

## Criteria Scores
| Criteria | Score |
|---|---|
| Problem Framing | 4 |
| Coverage | 5 |
| Specificity | 4 |
| Actionability | 4 |
| Distinctiveness | 5 |
| Clarity | 5 |

## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Recognizes the core issue: bottlenecked pipeline velocity is a significant impediment.
- Emphasizes the need for root cause analysis to avoid recurring problems.
- Highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in pipeline optimization.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lacks concrete examples of bottleneck identification.  The assessment requires more detail on current pipeline metrics.
- Limited scope – doesn't explicitly address potential causes of bottlenecks (e.g., inefficient processes, outdated tools).
- The 'why' behind velocity is not thoroughly explained, needing more context to establish the urgency of the situation.
