> Metadata
> - **Model:** gemma3:1b
> - **Prompt:** `prompts/sales/sales-q006-Green.prompt.txt`

**Overall Score:** 4.6

## Summary
A rigorous analysis of pipeline velocity bottlenecks, prioritizing a multi-faceted approach to identifying and resolving constraints. The assessment balances objective data with creative exploration of potential solutions. We’ve prioritized a deep dive into the root causes, suggesting several targeted interventions.

## Criteria Scores
| Criteria | Score |
|---|---|
| Problem Framing | 4 |
| Coverage | 5 |
| Specificity | 4 |
| Actionability | 4 |
| Distinctiveness | 5 |
| Clarity | 5 |

## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Clearly defines 'pipeline velocity bottlenecks' – a crucial operational focus.
- Emphasizes a holistic examination – considering various stages and contributors.
- Proposes a combination of data analysis and disruptive thinking to create novel solutions.
- Acknowledges the iterative nature of issue resolution – a critical point for long-term improvement.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lacks specific data metrics or key performance indicators (KPIs) currently defined for ‘velocity’ – requiring preliminary definition.
- The proposed 'disruptive thinking' aspect is somewhat vague – requiring further elaboration on what ‘disruptive’ means within this context.
- Could benefit from quantification of ‘success’ for proposed interventions – suggesting targeted metrics would strengthen the analysis.
