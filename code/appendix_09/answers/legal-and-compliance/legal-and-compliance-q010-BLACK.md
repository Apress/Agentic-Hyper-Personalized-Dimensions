## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Recognizes the critical importance of speed – a core directive for Black’s operational strategy.
- Identifies potential bottlenecks – requires immediate investigation.
- Acknowledges the need for optimized workflows.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lack of specific metrics for ‘shortening’ and ‘recovery’ – requiring precise quantification of objectives.
