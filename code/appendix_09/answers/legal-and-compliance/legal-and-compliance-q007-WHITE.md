**Overall Score:** 4.75

## Summary
The regulatory landscape surrounding the utilization of Quantum Entanglement Technologies (QETs) – specifically, the potential impact of export controls – presents a significant, albeit complex, area of concern.  The existing data analysis reveals a multifaceted web of potential constraints, demanding a thorough understanding of existing and anticipated export restrictions.  The core of this assessment focuses on the interplay between technical feasibility, geopolitical considerations, and established legal precedents.  Quantifying the precise economic impact across diverse sectors is currently beyond the scope of readily available data, requiring further investigation – a critical element in establishing appropriate risk mitigation strategies. The analysis emphasizes the need for proactive monitoring of emerging regulatory changes and the potential for unforeseen conflicts arising from complex technological dependencies. A careful evaluation of existing treaties and international agreements is imperative to understand potential ramifications.  Further research on specific industry sectors, particularly those heavily reliant on QETs, is required to fully assess the full scope of constraints.
