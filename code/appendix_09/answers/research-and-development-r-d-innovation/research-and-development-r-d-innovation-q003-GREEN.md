> - **Model:** gemma3:1b
> - **Prompt:** `prompts/research-and-development-r-d-innovation/research-and-development-r-d-innovation-q003-Green.prompt.txt`

**Overall Score:** 4.3

## Summary
Initial assessment suggests a robust approach to reducing product development costs and risk, leveraging innovative strategies and a focus on phased experimentation. Requires further refinement of cost-benefit analysis and risk mitigation plans.

## Criteria Scores
| Criteria | Score |
|---|---|
| Problem Framing | 4 |
| Coverage | 5 |
| Specificity | 4 |
| Actionability | 4 |
| Distinctiveness | 5 |
| Clarity | 5 |

## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Identifies multiple potential cost reduction techniques – agile methodologies, modular design, leveraging open-source tools.
- Highlights the critical importance of early risk assessment through prototyping and simulation.
- Emphasizes leveraging 'low-hanging fruit' – initial, easily implemented changes.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lacks a concrete budget allocation strategy. Quantifying potential ROI for each technique is missing.
- Doesn’t explicitly mention tools or methodologies specifically designed for rapid prototyping and iterative design.
- Doesn’t address the psychological barriers to innovation – framing the challenge as a challenge to overcome.
