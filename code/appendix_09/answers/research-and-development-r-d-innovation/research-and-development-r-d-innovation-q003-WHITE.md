## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Emphasis on Agile methodologies and iterative development creates faster time-to-market and reduced risk.
- Proactive risk assessment utilizing feasibility studies and sensitivity analysis provides a strong safety net.
- Leveraging existing technologies reduces initial investment and accelerates deployment.
- Phased approach minimizes initial investment and allows for adaptation based on feedback.

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited quantification of potential cost savings across different development phases.
- Lack of specific metrics for risk mitigation effectiveness (e.g., probability of failure, potential impact).
- Insufficient detail on specific risk assessment methodologies employed.
- No exploration of automation opportunities to improve efficiency.
