## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive framework for evaluating R&D spend.
- Explicit focus on measurable profit outcomes.
- Integration of multiple analytical approaches.
- Clearly defined 'specificity' criteria for evaluating the accuracy of the assessment.
- Emphasis on actionable insights derived from the framework.
