> - **Model:** gemma3:1b
> - **Prompt:** `prompts/research-and-development-r-d-innovation/research-and-development-r-d-innovation-q008-Green.prompt.txt`

**Overall Score:** 4.2

## Summary
Customer feedback loops are a critical component of R&D, but current implementation often lacks robust, data-driven optimization. The current model requires more explicit metrics to quantify success. This assessment highlights a need for a more formalized and automated process for continuous improvement, prioritizing qualitative analysis alongside quantitative data.

## Criteria Scores
| Criteria | Score |
|---|---|
| Problem Framing | 4 |
| Coverage | 5 |
| Specificity | 4 |
| Actionability | 4 |
| Distinctiveness | 5 |
| Clarity | 5 |

## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Strong emphasis on iterative feedback – crucial for R&D
- Recognition of the complexities of feedback data streams
- Addresses the need for proactive monitoring

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited discussion of specific feedback loop methodologies (e.g., sentiment analysis, root cause analysis)
- Doesn't explicitly address scalability challenges
- Missing granular measurement of loop effectiveness
