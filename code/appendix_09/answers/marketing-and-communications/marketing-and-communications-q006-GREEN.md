## Summary
Customer churn is a significant challenge, impacting revenue and strategic alignment. Current retention strategies often rely heavily on reactive measures, lacking proactive investigation into root causes.  A deeper understanding of why customers leave is crucial for effective mitigation.  Focus on identifying specific churn drivers through behavioral analysis and sentiment mapping would yield the most potent retention strategies.
