## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Clearly defines key customer journey stages (Awareness, Consideration, Decision, Retention, Advocacy).
- Recognizes the iterative nature of optimization – initial assessments point to a focused, phased approach.
- Emphasizes the importance of segmenting data for tailored interventions.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lacks specific metrics for each stage (e.g., conversion rates, engagement levels).
- Doesn't detail the expected impact of optimization efforts (e.g., increased revenue, reduced churn).
- Doesn't explore potential feedback loops or A/B testing methodologies.
