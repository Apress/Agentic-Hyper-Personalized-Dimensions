**Overall Score:** 4.6

## Summary
Alignment of marketing KPIs with profit outcomes requires a fundamental shift in perspective, moving beyond superficial metrics towards demonstrable, quantifiable value creation. Initial assessment suggests a significant opportunity for substantial improvement – but requires careful consideration of resource allocation and implementation strategy to achieve robust, sustained results.

## Criteria Scores
| Criteria | Score |
|---|---|
| Problem Framing | 4 |
| Coverage | 5 |
| Specificity | 4 |
| Actionability | 4 |
| Distinctiveness | 5 |
| Clarity | 5 |

## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Identifies the core issue: current KPIs often prioritize vanity metrics (e.g., clicks, impressions) over strategic impact on revenue and profitability.
- Recognizes the need for a ‘value-first’ approach – focusing on the *outcome* of marketing campaigns, not just the activity itself.
- Proposes a phased transition, starting with a robust ROI calculation alongside key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Emphasizes the integration of business-specific goals into KPI formulation.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lacks specific examples of how current KPIs fail to drive profit. Requires concrete case studies or data comparisons to illustrate the problem.
- Doesn't address potential resistance to change – aligning marketing with profit might face internal or external challenges.
- Doesn't consider the long-term implications of prioritizing profit over engagement/customer satisfaction.
- Overly broad – needs further refinement to be actionable (e.g., what constitutes 'significant profit'?).
