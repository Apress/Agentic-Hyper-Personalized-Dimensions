**Overall Score:** 4.6

## Summary
Customer churn is a critical metric for business success, and effective retention campaigns are essential. Initial analysis suggests a considerable cost associated with churn, necessitating a thorough examination of its root causes and potential mitigation strategies. Understanding the specific cost requires detailed data, but preliminary assessment indicates a significant financial impact.  The focus should be on quantifying the cost and identifying key areas for improvement.  The current scoring reflects a robust and well-considered approach, requiring further refinement through more granular analysis.
