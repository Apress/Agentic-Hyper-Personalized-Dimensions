## Summary
Alignment of marketing KPIs with profit outcomes requires a shift from vanity metrics – which primarily focus on engagement or impressions – to measurable, strategic results. This necessitates a more holistic and data-driven approach. We must demonstrate a robust link between effort and return, moving beyond superficial indicators to tangible economic benefits. The current focus on emotional engagement risks undermining true profitability.
