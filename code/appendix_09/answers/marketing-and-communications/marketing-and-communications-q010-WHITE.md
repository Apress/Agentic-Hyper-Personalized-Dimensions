**Overall Score:** 4.7

## Summary
Alignment of marketing KPIs with profit outcomes necessitates a shift from vanity metrics—which often prioritize reach or awareness—to metrics directly linked to revenue generation, customer lifetime value, and overall business profitability. This requires a fundamental recalibration of how success is measured and prioritized. The current approach frequently reflects marketing efforts without fully translating into tangible financial gains. The current data sets are largely descriptive, lacking sufficient context to definitively prove or disprove this alignment.  Furthermore, effective profit alignment demands rigorous analysis of long-term ROI, not just short-term impressions.
