## Summary
Detailed analysis of customer journey stages, incorporating multiple data points for each stage. Focus is on quantifying the performance of each stage through demonstrable metrics and a robust, data-driven approach.

## Criteria Scores
| Criteria | Score |
|---|---|
| Problem Framing | 5 |
| Coverage | 5 |
| Specificity | 4 |
| Actionability | 4 |
| Distinctiveness | 5 |
| Clarity | 5 |

## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive stage breakdown – including initial engagement, consideration, and action stages.
- Identification of key performance indicators (KPIs) for each stage (e.g., conversion rates, time on site, engagement metrics).
- Quantifiable estimates for stage performance - the average time to completion on key journeys and the percentage of users completing each stage.
- Strategic use of lifecycle stage analysis to pinpoint areas for optimization.
- Clear categorization of stages; providing a roadmap for improvement.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lack of specific data volume per stage – requires further elaboration on the available data to quantify potential improvements.
- Limited discussion on the *impact* of optimization efforts – needs more contextualization regarding the goals.
- No quantifiable metrics for success/failure – requires definition of desired outcomes.
- No assessment of current technology stack.
