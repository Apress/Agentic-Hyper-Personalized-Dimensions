# operations-q004 — Black

> Metadata
> - **Model:** gemma3:1b
> - **Prompt:** `prompts/operations/operations-q004-Black.prompt.txt`

**Overall Score:** 3.2

## Summary
Analysis suggests a moderate risk of rework and warranty costs without a robust, quantifiable control system. Current measures primarily rely on reactive problem-solving rather than proactive prevention.

## Criteria Scores
| Criteria | Score |
|---|---|
| Problem Framing | 3 |
| Coverage | 4 |
| Specificity | 3 |
| Actionability | 3 |
| Distinctiveness | 4 |
| Clarity | 4 |

## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Recognizes the importance of quality control but lacks specific, measurable targets.
- Points to the need for systematic process improvement rather than just superficial controls.
- Identifies a potential bottleneck: the lack of defined failure modes and their associated cost implications.

**Weaknesses:**
- Insufficient detail on specific rework and warranty cost reduction strategies.
- Limited exploration of preventative measures beyond basic inspection.
- No assessment of current tooling or technology utilized for quality assurance.
