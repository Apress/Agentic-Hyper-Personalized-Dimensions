> - **Prompt:** `prompts/operations/operations-q005-White.prompt.txt`

**Overall Score:** 4.75

## Summary
Scalability strategies – leveraging distributed infrastructure and automated processes – are analyzed with a high degree of detail and quantified potential impact, ensuring a robust and adaptable system architecture.  The assessment considers diverse approaches, including modular design and cloud-based deployment, effectively addressing the demands of increasing user base and data volume.  Specifically, the focus on utilizing microservices and containerization significantly enhances resilience and responsiveness, minimizing downtime and optimizing resource utilization. Quantified risk mitigation measures – such as phased deployment and continuous monitoring – are deemed crucial for sustained operational performance, making this dimension highly effective.
