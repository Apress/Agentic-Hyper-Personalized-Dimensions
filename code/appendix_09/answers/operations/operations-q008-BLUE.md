> - **Prompt:** `prompts/operations/operations-q008-Blue.prompt.txt`

**Overall Score:** 4.6

## Summary
Analyzing current inventory policies to identify optimal turns and safety stock levels with minimized working capital and obsolescence risk. The assessment prioritizes efficient capital management through precise data-driven recommendations. The scoring reflects a strong focus on practical strategies, considering both financial and operational implications.

## Criteria Scores
| Criteria | Score |
|---|---|
| Problem Framing | 4 |
| Coverage | 5 |
| Specificity | 4 |
| Actionability | 4 |
| Distinctiveness | 5 |
| Clarity | 5 |

## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Clearly defines the core objective: minimizing both working capital and obsolescence.
- Emphasizes a balanced approach – both financial and operational concerns.
- Highlights a practical focus on achievable improvements through optimized turn and stock levels.
- The inclusion of 'assessment' suggests a thorough, proactive methodology

**Weaknesses:**
- Lacks specific metrics for quantifying 'working capital' and 'obsolescence' – requiring further data collection.
- Could benefit from a deeper consideration of long-term obsolescence risks – simply focusing on current risk is insufficient.
- The justification lacks a more detailed explanation of the 'blue' dimension’s approach. It is currently relying solely on 'assessment'.
