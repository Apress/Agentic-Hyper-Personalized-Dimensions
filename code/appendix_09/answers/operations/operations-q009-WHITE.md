## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Prioritization of detailed cost analysis – a core directive.
- Emphasis on quantifiable performance indicators – essential for assessment.
- Structured approach incorporating multiple criteria – appropriate for complex evaluation.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lack of quantifiable targets for improvement – requires specific KPIs.
- Limited discussion of risk mitigation – potential for overlooked vulnerabilities.
- No established methodology for benchmarking – requires further refinement.
