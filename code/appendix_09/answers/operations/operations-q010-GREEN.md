## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Clearly articulates the core relationship between improvements and reduced costs; provides a logical chain of reasoning.
- Recognizes the proactive nature of safety improvements as a key driver of cost savings; highlights the long-term value.
- Emphasizes a holistic view incorporating both immediate cost reductions and reduced risk, creating a compelling argument for investment.
