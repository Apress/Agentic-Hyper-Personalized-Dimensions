## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Acknowledges the core objective of cost reduction.
- Identifies a potential risk of prioritizing scalability over efficiency.
- Suggests a need for detailed cost-benefit analysis.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lacks concrete examples of 'improving scalability' – relies on broad statements.
- Doesn't address potential vulnerabilities introduced by overly aggressive scalability.
- Limited consideration of long-term sustainability of scaled systems.
