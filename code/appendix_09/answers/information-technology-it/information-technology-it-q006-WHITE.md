# information-technology-it-q006 — White

> Metadata
> - **Model:** gemma3:1b
> - **Prompt:** `prompts/information-technology-it/information-technology-it-q006-White.prompt.txt`

**Overall Score:** 4.75

## Summary
Analysis of comprehensive data, prioritizing rigorous assessment across key dimensions. The model considers multiple data sources and methodologies.

## Criteria Scores
| Criteria | Score |
|---|---|
| Problem Framing | 5 |
| Coverage | 5 |
| Specificity | 4 |
| Actionability | 4 |
| Distinctiveness | 5 |
| Clarity | 5 |

## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Detailed breakdown of build vs. buy cost considerations.
- Explicitly quantified lifecycle costs with estimated duration and maintenance.
- Recognition of potential variability in component costs across different vendors.
- Recognition of significant long-term investment needs (e.g., infrastructure upgrades).

**Weaknesses:**
- Lack of specific cost breakdowns by component (e.g., server, storage, network).
- Limited consideration of potential obsolescence and replacement costs.
- No explicit weighting of various factors (risk, performance, scalability).
- Missing information on total service level agreements (SLAs).
