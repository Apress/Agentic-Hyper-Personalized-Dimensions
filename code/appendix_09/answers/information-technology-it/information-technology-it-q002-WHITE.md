## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Thorough examination of multiple systems including cloud-based and on-premise solutions.
- Focus on quantifying total cost of ownership, considering licensing, maintenance, and operational expenses.
- Identification of systems with the lowest ROI based on projected lifespan and usage.
- Incorporation of data from various sources like Gartner, Forrester, and industry reports.

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited scope – primarily focuses on publicly available data and does not delve into detailed financial modeling or risk analysis.
- Lack of granular cost breakdowns across different phases of a system’s lifecycle (e.g., initial investment, operational costs, disposal).
- No specific weighting assigned to different cost metrics (e.g., lifespan, scalability, maintenance cost).
- No consideration of potential long-term risks or obsolescence.
