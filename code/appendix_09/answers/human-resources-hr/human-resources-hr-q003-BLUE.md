    "summary": "This assessment considers various factors – engagement, cost reduction, and strategy implementation – requiring a robust analysis. The response prioritizes comprehensive and well-supported recommendations, demonstrating a strong understanding of the complexities involved. The proposed solutions are likely effective and thoughtfully crafted. The document presents a detailed and logical structure for exploring the topic. It’s reasonably detailed and provides a clear pathway for actionable next steps.",
    "strengths": [
      "Clearly identifies key areas for reducing turnover (engagement)",
      "Proposes a multi-faceted approach considering both cost and employee satisfaction",
      "Uses a structured methodology – focuses on identifying root causes",
      "Offers concrete suggestions (e.g., improved communication, training) for engagement",
      "Clearly demonstrates an understanding of turnover costs."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks specific data on existing turnover costs and engagement metrics to quantify the impact of potential solutions. A tangible baseline would strengthen the assessment.",
      "Could benefit from including a cost-benefit analysis for each proposed solution. ",
      "While the suggestions are valid, some are somewhat broad and lack specificity (e.g., ‘improve communication’ – what *specifically*?).",
      "The justification could be slightly expanded with supporting evidence or examples.”
