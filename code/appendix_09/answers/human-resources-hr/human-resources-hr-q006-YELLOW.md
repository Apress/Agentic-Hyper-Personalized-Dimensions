# human-resources-hr-q006 — Yellow

> Metadata
> - **Model:** gemma3:1b
> - **Prompt:** `prompts/human-resources-hr/human-resources-hr-q006-Yellow.prompt.txt`

**Overall Score:** 4.2

## Summary
The current reward structure – primarily focusing on output metrics – risks prioritizing activity over sustained profitability. While current incentive models are effective for immediate gains, they lack the robust financial modeling needed to ensure long-term, sustainable growth. This evaluation highlights a potential disconnect between high activity and bottom-line results, necessitating a shift towards a more integrated, performance-based approach.

## Criteria Scores
| Criteria | Score |
|---|---|
| Problem Framing | 4 |
| Coverage | 5 |
| Specificity | 4 |
| Actionability | 4 |
| Distinctiveness | 5 |
| Clarity | 5 |

## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Identifies the inherent risk of over-reliance on activity metrics.
- Points to a need for a more nuanced understanding of 'value' beyond simply output.
- Recognizes the potential for misalignment between current incentives and strategic objectives.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lacks specific examples of reward structures currently in use. Requires a detailed analysis of existing practices to identify vulnerabilities.
- Doesn't quantify the impact of current incentives on profitability – a crucial element for robust assessment.
- Doesn’t address potential negative consequences of a purely activity-driven model (e.g., employee burnout, reduced innovation).
