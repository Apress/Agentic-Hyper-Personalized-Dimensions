## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Quantifiable impact assessment through identifying core competencies.
- Focus on practical, adaptable skills – not simply rote knowledge.
- Emphasis on 'shifting paradigms' rather than just addressing surface-level deficiencies.
- Recognizes the value of cross-training – critical for future growth.

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited scope – currently focusing on a narrow set of skills.  Requires further segmentation by sector or business function.
- Lack of specific data on current skill levels (e.g., assessment scores, training completion rates).
- No detailed cost-benefit analysis – assessing the ROI of different skill gap remediation strategies is crucial.
- Missing a detailed understanding of current business processes that might be impeding skill acquisition.
