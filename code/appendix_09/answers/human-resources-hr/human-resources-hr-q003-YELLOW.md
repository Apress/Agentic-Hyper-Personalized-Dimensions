> - **Prompt:** `prompts/human-resources-hr/human-resources-hr-q003-Yellow.prompt.txt`

**Overall Score:** 4.2

## Summary
This evaluation focuses on a proactive, data-driven approach to reducing turnover costs. Initial assessment suggests a strong potential for improvement through strategic engagement strategies, leveraging quantifiable metrics to drive real-world impact. The identified strengths include a clearly defined framework and a focus on actionable solutions. However, the assessment requires further granularization to fully demonstrate the potential for significant gains, particularly concerning the specific metrics currently in play. The existing focus on ‘engagement’ requires clarifying the *type* of engagement being pursued – this will inform the most effective strategies. Furthermore, the current justification lacks concrete examples of past successes, presenting a somewhat generalized assessment.

## Criteria Scores

| Clarity | 5 |

## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Recognizes the importance of turnover reduction and proactive engagement.
- Proposes a data-driven approach – suggesting quantifiable metrics are crucial.
- Establishes a structured framework for improvement.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lacks quantifiable targets for improvement (e.g., reduction in turnover rate, cost per turnover).
- Justification is somewhat superficial – needs more detail about the current engagement practices.
- Doesn’t delve deeply into potential underlying causes of turnover (beyond surface-level ‘engagement’).
