## Criteria Scores
| Criteria | Score |
|---|---|
| Problem Framing | 4 |
| Coverage | 5 |
| Specificity | 4 |
| Actionability | 4 |
| Distinctiveness | 5 |
| Clarity | 5 |

## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Explicitly addresses the core question of incentivizing profit through alternative reward models.
- Emphasizes ‘breakthrough’ thinking – recognizing the need for unconventional approaches.
- Utilizes a weighted scoring system that considers multiple facets of the evaluation.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lacks detailed examples of reward structures, potentially hindering concrete recommendations. Needs probing to specify practical application.
- The justification section is relatively brief; more specific examples of ‘innovative’ reward systems would strengthen the analysis.
- ‘Distinctiveness’ score is low; requires more explicit criteria for differentiation.
