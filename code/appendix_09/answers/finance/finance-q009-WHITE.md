## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive approach encompassing multiple risk factors.
- Modular design for adaptability across diverse industries.
- Emphasis on proactive risk management, reducing potential negative outcomes.
- Incorporates simulation and optimization techniques for targeted resilience enhancement.

**Weaknesses:**
- Reliance on accurate data input – data quality can significantly impact results.
- Potential for computational complexity – large-scale modelling may demand significant computational resources.
- Requires careful calibration of modelling parameters – ‘optimisation’ needs precise parameters to yield realistic results.  Current model lacks defined sensitivity analysis.
- Lack of specific implementation details – the framework primarily focuses on modelling, lacking practical operational strategies.
