# finance-q006 — White

> Metadata
> - **Model:** gemma3:1b
> - **Prompt:** `prompts/finance/finance-q006-White.prompt.txt`

**Overall Score:** 4.75

## Summary
The proposed strategies to improve collection efficiency and debtor days are supported by substantial evidence and rigorous analysis. Specifically, utilizing predictive modeling for credit risk assessment has been shown to increase recovery rates, suggesting a significant improvement. Furthermore, implementing automated data collection processes streamlines the process significantly. However, a quantitative evaluation of the impact on debtor days, measured by a defined metric, is required for a more robust assessment.

## Criteria Scores
