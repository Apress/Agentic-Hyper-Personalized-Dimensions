**Overall Score:** 4.6

## Summary
Modeling offers a robust framework for assessing resilience, particularly through dynamic scenario simulation. The focus on multi-faceted risk assessment—economic, operational, and regulatory—is crucial for long-term sustainability. The incorporation of quantifiable metrics (e.g., projected revenue, cost of capital, regulatory impact) will enhance the model’s value and analytical power. The suggested use of Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating varying probability distributions for key variables, represents a promising approach to quantifying resilience probabilities and identifying vulnerabilities. A carefully designed sensitivity analysis – examining the impact of each scenario's key drivers – is vital for strategic prioritization. Further refinement of the scenario modeling process should involve establishing clear thresholds for 'failure' points, linking these thresholds to actionable mitigation strategies, and validating the model’s outputs using real-world data. The challenge lies in translating complex, qualitative risk assessments into concrete, verifiable projections. The model’s current lack of defined risk tolerance levels necessitates establishing clear parameters for acceptable variability and failure rates, significantly impacting practical implementation.
