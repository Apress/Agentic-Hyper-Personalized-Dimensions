> - **Prompt:** `prompts/finance/finance-q001-Black.prompt.txt`

**Overall Score:** 3.2

## Summary
Initial assessment requires further scrutiny; revenue drivers are moderately reliant on market trends, margin projections appear less certain, and cost structures require more detailed analysis to identify key opportunities for optimization. The current assessment doesn’t provide sufficient granularity to fully understand the potential risks.
