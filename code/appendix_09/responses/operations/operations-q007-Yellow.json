Current methodologies primarily rely on historical data and qualitative assessments, leading to potential stockout and overproduction risks. While these approaches offer a foundational basis, increased data granularity, predictive modeling, and automated optimization are crucial for enhanced effectiveness. Focusing on quantified metrics – specifically lead times, inventory turnover, and forecast accuracy – will yield the most impactful improvements.\",\n    \"strengths\": [\n      \"Clearly identifies the key areas of concern: stockouts and overproduction.\",\n      \"Acknowledges the limitations of current methods.\",\n      \"Emphasizes the need for data-driven improvements.\",\n      \"Highlights potential for significant yield gains through advanced techniques.\"\n    ],\n    \"weaknesses\": [\n      \"Lacks specific recommendations for implementation beyond general principles.
