Initial assessment suggests a robust, layered approach to increase capacity, but requires a detailed analysis of current infrastructure and resource allocation to ensure optimal deployment. The core focus should be on modularity and automated scaling techniques.  We need to prioritize efficiency without sacrificing quality, considering potential bottlenecks in existing processes.  Currently, the focus is on identifying and analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) to quantify scaling needs.  Further investigation into automation strategies is essential.\",\n    \"strengths\": [\n      \"Well-structured approach considering multiple layers of scalability.\",\n      \"Explicitly recognizes the need for automation.\",\n      \"Acknowledges the importance of KPI monitoring.\",\n      \"Clear prioritization of modularity & automated scaling.\"\n    ],\n    \"weaknesses\": [\n      \"Lacks specific scalability metrics currently.\",\n      \"Doesn't address potential organizational resistance to change.\",\n      \"Doesn't fully define the intended scaling scenarios.\",\n      \"Requires more detailed data analysis to support recommendations.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```",
