While all channels demonstrate respectable performance, certain channels – specifically, channel A and channel B – are exhibiting comparatively lower CAC ratios compared to the top-performing channels. This warrants further investigation into the reasons behind these differences, particularly concerning optimization strategies for these underperforming segments.\",\n    \"strengths\": [\n      \"Comprehensive evaluation across multiple channels.\",\n      \"Well-structured scoring based on established metrics.\",\n      \"Detailed analysis of key channel performance.\",\n      \"Acknowledges the potential for improvement within the current setup.\"\n    ],\n    \"weaknesses\": [\n      \"Limited data on specific channel performance metrics (e.g., cost per acquisition).\",\n      \"No quantitative data on CAC ratios.\",\n      \"Lack of granular segmentation of channel performance.\",\n      \"Requires deeper investigation of underperforming channels.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```",
