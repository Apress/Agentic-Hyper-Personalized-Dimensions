Current forecasting methods often rely on statistical models which, while valuable, can be susceptible to 'noise' and unforeseen events.  Therefore, significant improvements in model robustness are required to reduce surprises.  Furthermore, incorporating dynamic data assimilation techniques – incorporating real-time feedback from diverse sources – would significantly enhance predictive accuracy.  While the focus is on *improving* forecasting, proactive mitigation strategies are crucial, necessitating deeper understanding of the root causes of forecast error. This evaluation prioritizes a layered approach to improve accuracy through a combination of enhanced model development, enhanced data integration, and a robust risk assessment framework.\",\n    \"strengths\": [\n      \"Clearly defines the core challenge: improved forecasting accuracy.\",\n      \"Highlights the importance of dynamic data and risk assessment.\",\n      \"Emphasizes layered improvement strategy - model, data, and risk\"\n    ],\n    \"weaknesses\": [\n      \"Lacks specific quantitative targets for accuracy reduction (e.g., MAPE, RMSE).\",\n      \"Doesn't detail the specific techniques to achieve enhancements (e.g., reinforcement learning, anomaly detection).\",\n      \"Doesn't propose a clear path to implementation (e.g., pilot programs, phased rollout).\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```",
