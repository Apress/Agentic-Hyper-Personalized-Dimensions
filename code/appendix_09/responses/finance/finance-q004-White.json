Implementation of real-time data assimilation and incorporating external risk factors have demonstrably improved forecast precision. However, the precise quantification of forecast error variance across various economic sectors requires further granular analysis. Current forecasting models primarily rely on historical correlations; incorporating novel causal factors could further enhance accuracy.\",\n    \"strengths\": [\n      \"Utilization of Bayesian Networks for probabilistic forecasting – enhancing model robustness and uncertainty quantification.\",\n      \"Implementation of Ensemble Modeling (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) – mitigating overfitting and improving predictive performance across diverse datasets.\",\n      \"Real-time Data Assimilation – dynamically incorporating new information into forecasting models – increasing accuracy.\",\n      \"Incorporation of External Risk Factors – explicitly accounting for potential macroeconomic shocks – improving forecast flexibility.\",\n      \"Advanced Data Analytics – utilizing unsupervised learning for anomaly detection - facilitating proactive risk management.\"\n    ],\n    \"weaknesses\": [\n      \"Reliance on Historical Data – inherent risk of backward forecasting – necessitating continuous model adaptation.\",\n      \"Limited Scope – Focusing primarily on macroeconomic trends – neglecting micro-economic factors – potentially overlooking critical market segments.\",\n      \"Model Complexity – Increased computational demands – requiring significant infrastructure investment – affecting scalability.\",\n      \"Sensitivity to Data Quality – Vulnerable to data errors or anomalies – potentially leading to erroneous forecasts – a persistent challenge.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```",
