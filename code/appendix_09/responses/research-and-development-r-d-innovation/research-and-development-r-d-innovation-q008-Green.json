The current model requires more explicit metrics to quantify success. This assessment highlights a need for a more formalized and automated process for continuous improvement, prioritizing qualitative analysis alongside quantitative data.\",\n    \"strengths\": [\n      \"Strong emphasis on iterative feedback – crucial for R&D\",\n      \"Recognition of the complexities of feedback data streams\",\n      \"Addresses the need for proactive monitoring\"\n    ],\n    \"weaknesses\": [\n      \"Limited discussion of specific feedback loop methodologies (e.g., sentiment analysis, root cause analysis)\",\n      \"Doesn't explicitly address scalability challenges\",\n      \"Missing granular measurement of loop effectiveness\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```",
