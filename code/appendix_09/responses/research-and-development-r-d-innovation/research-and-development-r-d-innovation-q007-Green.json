Initial assessment indicates a strong focus on exploring unconventional methods to ascertain profitability. The model requires further refinement to incorporate concrete financial metrics and risk assessment, but it presents a promising starting point.\",\n    \"strengths\": [\n      \"Clearly defines the central research question.\",\n      \"Emphasizes the necessity of quantifying impact.\",\n      \"Recognizes the potential for unorthodox methodologies.\",\n      \"Demonstrates a holistic approach.\"\n    ],\n    \"weaknesses\": [\n      \"Lacks specific quantifiable thresholds for 'measurable profit outcomes'.\",\n      \"Limited exploration of potential metrics beyond simple revenue generation.\",\n      \"No explicit mention of operational efficiency or strategic alignment.\",\n      \"Doesn’t consider potential intangible benefits (brand value, market share) alongside financial gains.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```",
