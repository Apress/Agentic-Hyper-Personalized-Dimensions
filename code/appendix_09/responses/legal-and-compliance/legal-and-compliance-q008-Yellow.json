However, further analysis is needed to quantify the effectiveness of current controls and establish a robust, quantifiable baseline for future performance monitoring.  The current assessment leans towards a positive outcome, but requires more granular detail for full validation.  The focus is on presenting a well-considered evaluation, acknowledging the need for precise measurement.\",\n    \"strengths\": [\n      \"Clearly states the objective of the evaluation – alignment with risk and cost.\",\n      \"Emphasizes a proactive approach to data management practices.\",\n      \"Identifies key areas for further investigation (quantification).\"\n    ],\n    \"weaknesses\": [\n      \"Lacks specific metrics or thresholds for risk and cost assessment.
