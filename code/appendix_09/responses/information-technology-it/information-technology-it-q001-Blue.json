While technology offers significant potential for cost reduction and efficiency gains, it’s crucial to analyze *how* this is achieved and whether these improvements are sustainable in the long term. A careful examination of automation, process optimization, and resource utilization is necessary to determine the effectiveness of these changes. Initial assessments suggest promising results, but require deeper investigation into the implementation strategies.\",\n    \"strengths\": [\n      \"Automation capabilities – platforms like Robotic Process Automation (RPA) can significantly streamline repetitive tasks, reducing labor costs and improving speed.\",\n      \"Cloud computing – Offers scalable infrastructure and reduced IT operational overhead.\",\n      \"Data analytics – Enables data-driven insights for process optimization and predictive maintenance.\",\n      \"Collaboration tools – Enhance team productivity and reduce communication bottlenecks.\"\n    ],\n    \"weaknesses\": [\n      \"Implementation complexity – Successfully deploying technology requires careful planning, skilled personnel, and organizational buy-in.\",\n      \"Cybersecurity risks – Increased reliance on digital systems introduces vulnerabilities to security breaches.\",\n      \"Employee training – Resistance to change and lack of necessary skills can hinder the adoption of new technologies.\",\n      \"Vendor lock-in – Dependence on a single technology provider can limit flexibility and increase costs.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```",
