It utilizes a structured framework and emphasizes the importance of data-driven analysis to minimize risk. The analysis is logically structured with clear delineation of the key objectives, methods, and potential consequences. The identified strengths highlight a focus on proactive risk mitigation, while the identified weaknesses call for more granular data collection and prioritization.\",\n    \"strengths\": [\n      \"Clearly defines key objectives: minimizing lock-in, maximizing commercial terms.\",\n      \"Suggests a phased approach – assessment, negotiation, monitoring.\",\n      \"Emphasizes data-driven analysis for informed decisions.\",\n      \"Recognizes the importance of ongoing monitoring of commercial terms.\"\n    ],\n    \"weaknesses\": [\n      \"Lacks specific metrics for evaluating the success of negotiation efforts.
