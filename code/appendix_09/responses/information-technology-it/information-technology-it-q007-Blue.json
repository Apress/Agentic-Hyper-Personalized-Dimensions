Current measures risk substantial fines and substantial rework, necessitating a highly systematic and comprehensive plan.  The suggested augmentation of data lineage tracking, enhanced access controls, and rigorous compliance auditing are all critically important.  Furthermore, the lack of defined metrics for success will hinder accurate assessment of effectiveness. The integration of automated monitoring tools and continuous feedback loops will be vital.\",\n    \"strengths\": [\n      \"Recognizes the potential for severe financial consequences and operational disruption.\",\n      \"Proposes a multi-layered approach – encompassing policy, technology, and personnel – addressing multiple layers of risk.\",\n      \"Emphasizes proactive risk identification and mitigation through data lineage, access controls, and auditing.\",\n      \"Calls for continuous monitoring and automated reporting to ensure ongoing compliance.\"\n    ],\n    \"weaknesses\": [\n      \"Lacks detailed implementation strategies for each proposed enhancement.  ‘Strengthening’ is a broad term requiring more concrete action.\",\n      \"No specific data governance framework is outlined.
