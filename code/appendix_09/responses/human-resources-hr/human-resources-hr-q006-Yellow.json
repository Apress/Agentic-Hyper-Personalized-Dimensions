While current incentive models are effective for immediate gains, they lack the robust financial modeling needed to ensure long-term, sustainable growth. This evaluation highlights a potential disconnect between high activity and bottom-line results, necessitating a shift towards a more integrated, performance-based approach.\",\n    \"strengths\": [\n      \"Identifies the inherent risk of over-reliance on activity metrics.\",\n      \"Points to a need for a more nuanced understanding of 'value' beyond simply output.\",\n      \"Recognizes the potential for misalignment between current incentives and strategic objectives.\"\n    ],\n    \"weaknesses\": [\n      \"Lacks specific examples of reward structures currently in use.
