> - **Prompt:** `prompts/q6-White.prompt.txt`

**Overall Score:** 4.2

## Summary
The analysis of potential impacts, encompassing economic, social, and governance dimensions, is thorough, underpinned by data-driven assessments of feasibility and potential risks. While quantitative projections are limited, a robust framework for evaluation is presented. The nuanced considerations of funding models and potential dependency mitigations are particularly noteworthy. The assessment utilizes a mixed approach of data-based analysis and logical reasoning, presenting a well-structured and comprehensive overview.

## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Detailed examination of various funding models (e.g., taxation, wealth redistribution, non-profit programs)
- Analysis of potential dependency effects on workforce participation and social cohesion
- Recognition of the need for adaptive policy implementation
- Comprehensive consideration of externalities associated with UBI

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited scope of potential economic modeling beyond basic GDP projections.
- Insufficient data on the long-term behavioral effects of UBI, particularly in complex societal contexts.
- Lack of specific projections for labor market shifts.
- Insufficient discussion of systemic vulnerabilities exacerbated by UBI implementation.
