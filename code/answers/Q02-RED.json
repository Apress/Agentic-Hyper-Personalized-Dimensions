  "dimension": "RED",
  "answer": "Okay.\n\n**Feeling:** A prickling unease. A cold weight in the chest.\n\n**Intuition:** It’s a deflection, isn’t it? A quick fix masking a deeper, messy problem.\n\n**Hunch:**  Economic devastation, widespread suffering… a shift in the natural order.\n\n**Analysis:**  It *could* work. The initial shock is significant.  A levied tax, even a high one, *might* force recalibration.  But it’s brittle.  It’s a band-aid on a wound that’s bleeding. \n\n**Economic Impact:**  Initially, a massive disruption.  Losses in sectors reliant on fossil fuels.  Inflation could spike, destabilizing economies globally.  Tax revenue generated might be short-term gains, offset by long-term decline.  A fragmented market, with businesses relocating.\n\n**Fairness:**  The core issue.  The burden falls disproportionately on the poorest.  Those least responsible for the problem are bearing the brunt of the solution. It’s a moral failing disguised as a pragmatic step.  It’s like placing a band-aid on a gaping wound.\n\n**Risks of Unintended Consequences:**  Economic stagnation.  Political instability fueled by resentment.  Black markets and corruption blossoming.  A weakening of global trade.  Resource shifts – nations with less carbon intensity might gain an advantage.  Job losses across sectors. \n\n**Long-Term Benefits:**  *Potentially* a stabilizing effect if coupled with massive investment in renewables and carbon capture.  A shift towards a more sustainable, equitable system.  Perhaps a greater appreciation for ecological balance, influencing future policy.  *But* the disruption is unpredictable. It risks creating new, harder-to-manage problems than it solves.\n\n**Overall:** A gamble.  A dangerous one.  It demands extreme caution.  It’s a strategic maneuver that might achieve its goal, but at a terrible cost.\n\n**Feeling:** A deep, unsettling calm, overlaid with a growing desperation.  The weight of potential ruin feels immense.",
