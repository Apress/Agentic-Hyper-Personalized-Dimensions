## Analysis Highlights
**Strengths:**
- Addresses a significant global challenge – climate change.
- Carbon tax offers a potential mechanism for incentivizing sustainable practices.
- Economic impacts, while potentially complex, are worth examining.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lack of specific model projections and cost estimates.
- Limited consideration of distributional effects – disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations.
- Requires a robust framework for monitoring and enforcement to avoid evasion.
