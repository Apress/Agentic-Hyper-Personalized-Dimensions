## 📘 Overview
*Six Dimensions: AI-Powered Thinking Framework* explores how artificial intelligence can mirror and enhance the six thinking dimensions — factual, emotional, judgmental, optimistic, creative, and process-oriented reasoning.  
The book blends cognitive psychology, AI systems design, and applied data science to introduce a novel framework for **AI-assisted decision intelligence**.

## 🧠 Core Concept
The **Six Dimensions Framework** applies AI-powered viewpoints to simulate diverse cognitive perspectives:
- **White Dimension:** The factual, data-driven AI viewpoint.  
- **Red Dimension:** The instinctive, emotional AI viewpoint.  
- **Black Dimension:** The judgement and evidence-based AI viewpoint.  
- **Yellow Dimension:** The optimistic AI viewpoint.  
- **Green Dimension:** The creative, exploratory AI viewpoint.  
- **Blue Dimension:** The process and orchestration AI viewpoint.
